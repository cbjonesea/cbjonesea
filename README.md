## Hi, I'm Chels ðŸ‘‹
---------------------------------------------
I'm a data analyst and aspiring data engineer.

After leaving my home country in 2014 and making my way through Spain and Germany, I've finally settled in the Netherlands.

## About Me
--------------------------------------------
I originally studied Natural Resource Management and worked for 5 years as a researcher on sustainability and climate change in both academica and non-profits. After being bitten by the coding bug shortly after finishing my M.Sc., I started diving more in depth into data science and programming.

I'm now working on fully transitioning my career to data. Here you can see some of the projects I'm working on to build my skillset and show what I'm capable of.
