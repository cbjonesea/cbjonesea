## Hi, I'm Chels ðŸ‘‹
I'm a data analyst and aspiring data engineer. 

Some of my projects use fictional business cases as a basis to hone my data analysis skills and demonstrate them to employers.

Some are my own explorations into data related to current events, new stories or political and environmental issues.

Based in ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±

## Background
I originally studied Natural Resource Management and worked for 5 years as a researcher on sustainability and climate change in both academica and non-profits. After being bitten by the coding bug shortly after finishing my M.Sc., I started diving more in depth into data science and programming.

I'm now working on fully transitioning my career to data. Here you can see some of the projects I'm working on to build my skillset and show what I'm capable of.
