# Portfolio Guide
I've made this guide so others can easily navigate to different projects within my portfolio. <br>
It also categorizes my projects based on subject area, data analysis processes undertaken and tools/libraries used. <br>
I will regularly update this guide as I keep learning and working on projects.
