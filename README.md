# Hi, I'm Chels ðŸ‘‹
I'm a data analyst and aspiring data engineer. 

This is my portfolio of data projects I'm using to practice existing skills and teach my self new ones.

Some of my projects use fictional business cases as a basis to hone my data analysis skills and demonstrate them to employers.

Some are my own explorations into data related to current events, news stories or political and environmental issues.


# Background
I originally studied Natural Resource Management and worked for 5 years as a researcher on sustainability and climate change in both academica and non-profits. 

After being bitten by the programming bug shortly after finishing my M.Sc., I started diving more into data science and programming.

I'm now working on fully transitioning my career to data. Here you can see some of the projects I'm working on to build my skillset and show what I'm capable of.

# Portfolio Guide
I've made this guide to so others can easily navigate to different projects within my portfolio. 

It also categorizes my projects based on subject area, data analysis processes undertaken and tools/libraries used. 

I will regularly update this guide as I keep learning and working on projects.
